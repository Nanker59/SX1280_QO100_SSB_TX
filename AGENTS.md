# AI Agents Used in This Project

This project was created entirely with the assistance of AI coding agents.

## Primary Agents

### Claude Opus 4.5 (Anthropic)
- **Role:** Main code generation, architecture design, DSP algorithms
- **Contributions:**
  - SX1280 driver implementation
  - USB Audio Class (UAC1) integration with TinyUSB
  - SSB modulation (Hilbert transform, I/Q generation)
  - Real-time DSP chain (bandpass filter, equalizer, compressor)
  - Dual-core architecture (Core0: USB+DSP, Core1: Radio TX)
  - Adaptive resampling with cubic Hermite interpolation
  - CDC command interface
  - TCXO initialization sequence debugging

### GPT 5.2 (OpenAI)
- **Role:** Code review, optimization suggestions, documentation
- **Contributions:**
  - Code optimization and refactoring
  - Documentation improvements
  - Alternative implementation approaches

## Development Process

The entire codebase was developed through iterative conversation with AI agents:

1. **Initial Setup** - Hardware verification and SX1280 communication
2. **USB Audio** - TinyUSB integration for audio input
3. **DSP Pipeline** - Filter design, Hilbert transform, SSB modulation
4. **Optimization** - Buffer management, adaptive resampling
5. **Features** - CDC commands, PPM correction, beacon mode
6. **Documentation** - README, LICENSE, wiring diagrams

## Human Contribution

**Kacper Kidała SP8ESA** provided:
- Project requirements and specifications
- Hardware setup and testing
- Real-world validation (QO-100 satellite tests)
- Direction and decision-making throughout development

## Note

This project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted embedded systems development. All code was generated by AI agents based on human specifications and iteratively refined through testing and feedback.
